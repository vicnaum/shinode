My current thinking revolves around pinpointing each method, classifying its necessity, tracing its codebase usage, and pinpointing the bare minimum response data required. I\u0027m also delving into how the live indexing works with these methods.\n\n\n**Investigating RPC Interactions**\n\nI\u0027m now diving into the `repomix-output.ponder.filtered.xml` file. My plan involves a keyword search for RPC method prefixes like \"eth_\", \"debug_\", etc., and also searching for `viem` actions, which should expose the underlying RPC calls. I\u0027ve started scanning `packages/core/src/rpc/index.ts` and noticed the `RpcSchema` definition and explicit inclusion of methods like `eth_getBlockReceipts` and `debug_traceBlockByHash`. I\u0027m starting to get a clear picture of how these calls are managed.\n\n\n**Identifying Core RPC Calls**\n\nI\u0027m presently focused on the explicit RPC calls within `packages/core/src/rpc/actions.ts`. I see `eth_getBlockByNumber`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, and `debug_traceBlockByHash` being directly invoked. In parallel, I\u0027ve noticed `blockDependentMethods` in `indexing/client.ts` containing key calls like `eth_getBalance` and `eth_call`.\n\n\n**Delineating RPC Interception**\n\nI\u0027m now identifying the RPC methods Ponder intercepts for indexing. My focus has shifted to the difference between internal interception and user-facing calls. Specifically, I see a clear separation between methods like `eth_feeHistory`, `eth_getProof`, `eth_getCode`, and those within the sync process. The lists in `indexing/client.ts` are key, but do they all get called internally? User actions rely on `eth_call`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getCode`, and `eth_getStorageAt`.\n\n\n**Refining Method Categorization**\n\nI\u0027ve been examining the code, focusing on `sync-historical/index.ts`, `sync-realtime/index.ts`, `build/index.ts`, and `rpc/index.ts`. I\u0027m seeing `eth_getLogs` for historical logs, along with methods for block and receipt retrieval. The `rpcDiagnostic` function calls `eth_chainId`, important for chain identification. Also, `eth_subscribe` is used for realtime updates. I also see that  `eth_getBlockByNumber` is used for both polling and sync progress. Now categorizing which calls are essential for baseline indexing.\n\n\n**Summarizing Core Requirements**\n\nI\u0027m presently focusing on the essential RPC methods for Ponder\u0027s operation. I\u0027ve broken them down into categories. For historical data, I need `eth_getLogs` for event fetching, `eth_getBlockByNumber` for timestamps, and `eth_getBlockByHash` for reorg management. `eth_call` is essential for interacting with contracts. For realtime data, `eth_subscribe` is useful, with polling as a fallback. I\u0027m also considering the implications of transaction and block filters and the need for full transaction objects or receipts.\n\n\n**Examining Data Standardization**\n\nI\u0027m now examining how the data is standardized within `packages/core/src/rpc/actions.ts`. Specifically, I\u0027m analyzing `standardizeBlock`, `standardizeLogs`, and `standardizeTransactionReceipts`. I\u0027m starting to grasp how required properties like `hash`, `number`, and `timestamp` are handled, along with fallbacks. I see that the same logic applies to receipts and logs.\n\n**Investigating Live Update Strategies**\n\nI am now focusing on live indexing. The `createRpc` function within `packages/core/src/rpc/index.ts` uses `eth_subscribe` for new heads via WebSocket. As a fallback, if WebSocket is unavailable, `setInterval` polls `eth_getBlockByNumber` for the latest block. This gives me insight into the real-time update strategy.\n\n\n**Revising Call Dependencies**\n\nNow, I\u0027m verifying the core RPC call dependencies through the lens of a typical event indexing scenario. My understanding is solidifying that `eth_getLogs` is indispensable for retrieving contract events. I\u0027m also confirming the need for `eth_getBlockByNumber` for timestamp retrieval and reorg handling, and `eth_chainId` for chain identification. `eth_call` for read operations is also vital.\n\n\n**Defining Core Method Uses**\n\nI\u0027m presently revising the list of essential RPC calls. I\u0027m focusing on clarifying method dependencies. My key findings include confirming the critical role of `eth_getBlockByHash` for robust reorg handling, and `eth_subscribe` as the preferred live update strategy with a polling fallback using `eth_getBlockByNumber`. I\u0027m starting to see how data standardization impacts call requirements.\n\n\n**Refining Error Handling**\n\nI\u0027m now zeroing in on error handling within the standardization processes. Specifically, `standardizeBlock` now explicitly throws an error if vital fields such as `hash`, `number`, `timestamp`, `logsBloom`, and `parentHash` are missing. Similarly, `standardizeTransactions` mandates the presence of `hash`, `transactionIndex`, `blockNumber`, `blockHash`, and `from`. The `transactions` array itself is also expected, unless this is a subscription result with no transaction flag.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Call Optimizations**\n\nI am now focusing on call optimization. I have started by clarifying Ponder\u0027s usage of `multicall3`, which is an optimization over single `eth_call` calls for reads. The system uses `eth_call` only if the user specifically uses the `readContract` function. Also, `debug_trace*` methods are only used if trace-related filters are enabled or `includeCallTraces` is true, indicating conditional usage.\n\n\n",

It strictly requires transaction objects (not just hashes) in block responses unless specifically configured otherwise, though it handles some `eth_subscribe` payloads that only return headers.*\n\n---\n\n### Minimum RPC Spec for Ponder Baseline Event Indexing\n\nTo support a standard Ponder application (indexing contract events, reading contract state, no tracing, no extra receipt data), an RPC provider must support:\n\n**1. General**\n- [x] **`eth_chainId`**: Must match the chain ID in `ponder.config.ts`.\n\n**2. Logs**\n- [x] **`eth_getLogs`**:\n    - Must support `fromBlock` and `toBlock`.\n    - Must support `address` (single or array).\n    - Must support `topics` filtering.\n    - Ponder has built-in retry logic to handle rate limits and block range limits (e.g., splitting 10k block ranges into smaller chunks), so strict range limits are acceptable but must be communicated via standard error messages (e.g., \"limit exceeded\").\n\n**3. Blocks (Full)**\n- [x] **`eth_getBlockByNumber`**:\n    - Must return full transaction objects (`hydrated: true`).\n    - **Crucial:** The `transactions` array must contain objects with `hash`, `transactionIndex`, `from`, `to`, `input`, `value`, `nonce`.\n    - **Crucial:** `logsBloom` is required for Ponder\u0027s optimization logic (it skips `getLogs` if the bloom filter doesn\u0027t match).\n    - `timestamp`, `number`, `hash`, `parentHash` are strict requirements.\n- [x] **`eth_getBlockByHash`**:\n    - Used during reorgs to walk the chain. Same response requirements as `getByNumber`.\n\n**4. Contract Interaction**\n- [x] **`eth_call`**:\n    - Ponder heavily relies on `multicall3`. The RPC must support `eth_call` to the Multicall3 contract address for the specific chain.\n    - Used for resolving Factory child contracts and user-land `context.client.readContract` calls.\n\n---\n\n### Optional Features \u0026 RPC Implications\n\nIf you are building a specialized RPC for Ponder, you can **omit** these methods if you accept reduced functionality:\n\n1.  **WebSockets (`eth_subscribe`)**:\n    - **Impact:** Live indexing will use polling (`eth_getBlockByNumber` every ~1s) instead of pushing.\n    - **Implementation:** Ponder detects if a `wss://` URL is provided. If not, it defaults to polling.\n\n2.  **`eth_getBlockReceipts` / `eth_getTransactionReceipt`**:\n    - **Impact:** Users cannot use `includeTransactionReceipts: true` in `ponder.config.ts` or filter by transaction status (success/reverted).\n    - **Implementation:** Ponder checks for `eth_getBlockReceipts` support and falls back to 1-by-1 `eth_getTransactionReceipt` calls.\n\n3.  **`debug_traceBlockBy*`**:\n    - **Impact:** Users cannot use `includeCallTraces: true` or index internal transfers/calls.\n    - **Implementation:** These are exclusively used for the \"Call Traces\" feature.\n\n4.  **`eth_getStorageAt`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getCode`**:\n    - **Impact:** Minimal. These are exposed to the user via `context.client` but are not used by the core indexing engine (except specific factory patterns might technically use `getCode` or `getStorage`, though `eth_call` is the primary mechanism).\n\n### Code References\n*   **Standardization Logic:** See `packages/core/src/rpc/actions.ts` (specifically `standardizeBlock`, `standardizeLogs`, `standardizeTransactions`). This file defines the exact fields Ponder throws errors on if missing.\n*   **Live Sync Fallback:** See `packages/core/src/rpc/index.ts`.
