      "text": "I want to index Uniswap v4 events without paying third-party RPC providers by building a stateless history client. “Stateless” here means: no EVM execution, no state trie/database, no archive/full node state growth. The client will only acquire and persist history artifacts needed for event indexing: canonical block headers (timestamp/number/hash/parent), transaction receipts (logs/events), and optionally a minimal extracted tx record (tx hash, from/to, value) rather than raw calldata. Correctness will be “stage-1 pragmatic”: I will accept weaker trust assumptions (e.g., trusting my own upstream sources or peer set) while still optionally validating that fetched receipts match the header’s receiptsRoot.\n\nPhase 1 (Ethereum L1): implement an EL devp2p/ETH history client that peers with Ethereum execution nodes and fetches headers + receipts (and optionally bodies for a short rolling window), storing only what’s required for indexing and re-serving cached data to remain a useful peer.\n\nPhase 2 (OP-based): After this works end-to-end on L1, extend the same principle to OP Stack L2s (Base, later Optimism): run the same style of client against op-geth/op-reth peers to fetch L2 headers + receipts over EL P2P, again without executing transactions or maintaining state. Only if peer history availability proves insufficient would I introduce heavier components (e.g., rollup-node derivation + execution client), but the intended path is P2P receipts ingestion → persistent receipts/log DB → indexer, staying stateless throughout. If needed - we can use our L1 RPC for op-node requirement (and can even filter the data it needs that\u0027s stored in L1 calldata).\n\n--\n\nI have done some research, and wrote a spec for a reth harness that I want to do. I want to to examine this (especially `harness_spec.md`) and try to understand the problem.\n\nThen I\u0027m attaching you reth.tree.txt that contains a folder tree and biggest files of the `reth` repository.\nI want to pick the context that is relevant to my task, and filter out everything else.\n\nPlease make me a list, which folders I should definitely exclude, and which ones I should definitely include.",

It skips `sparse`, `parallel`, and `sparse-parallel` (the #1 token bloat in your previous list), which are optimizations for full nodes and not needed for a simple receipt root check.\n*   Includes the **Ethereum \u0026 Optimism Primitive definitions** for Receipts and Logs.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: One \"Master\" Harness Context (Aggressive)\nIf you want **everything in one file** and want to stay under 1M, run this command. It uses precise globs to take only the \"Brain\" of each relevant crate:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --include \"{Cargo.toml,crates/net/network/src/**,crates/net/eth-wire/src/**,crates/net/eth-wire-types/src/**,crates/net/discv5/src/**,crates/chainspec/src/**,crates/optimism/chainspec/src/**,crates/primitives-traits/src/**,crates/ethereum/primitives/src/**,crates/trie/common/src/**,crates/trie/trie/src/**,examples/manual-p2p/src/**}\" --ignore \"**/{tests,benches,test_utils,testdata}/**\"\n```\n\n### Key Logic used for these selections:\n1.  **Skip the \"Sub-Tries\":** `crates/trie/sparse-parallel` alone is 76k tokens. You only need `trie/common` to build a standard Merkle Patricia Trie for verification.\n2.  **No `tests`/`benches`:** In Reth, the test code is often 2x the size of the implementation code.\n3.  **The \"src\" Only Rule:** By targeting `src/**` specifically, we ignore `README.md`, `Makefile`, and other root-level crate files that add up.\n4.  **Optimism Scope:** I included `optimism/chainspec` (Base genesis) and `optimism/primitives` (L2 Receipt types), but skipped the rest of the `optimism/` folder (which includes the sequencer, state, and batcher logic you don\u0027t need).\n\n**Which to run first?** \nI recommend **Split 1**.
